# <center> Task 3
**by Hyrisky He**

For this assignment, solutions are provided with `.py` file.\
Results were saved in `output` folder. You can also have a quick glimpse of the output in `log.txt`.

## Attention:

Use `print(os.getcwd())` to get the current working directory.\
The working directory were modified in `p06_spam.py`, you need to change it if you want to run it in your computer.

## Note:

Build a Spam Classifier with Naive Bayes and SVM core, Laplace Method were used to avoid accidental output `0`.\
Theorical part can be seen via this link: [CS229 GDA&NB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nt63k3bfXS0&list=PLoROMvodv4rMiGQp3WXShtMGgzqpfVfbU&index=5)

## Tasks:

This is a multifile program, `p06_spam.py` implements the NB algorithm, and SVM were given in `svm.py`.
- [p06_spam.py](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task_3/src/p06_spam.py)
- [svm.py](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task_3/src/svm.py)

## Conc:

Dirty work. SAD.
