# <center> PRML Notebook
**by Hyrisky He**

This repository compiles the assignments of BUPT PRML courses and my solutions to them.

I also referred Stanford's program.(CS229)\
Datasets and problems are mainly from Kaggle.([portal here](https://www.kaggle.com/))

For each assignments, solutions are provided as a `Ipython Notebook`.

## Task 1: Linear Regression

The first task deals with simple models.
- link to the solution: [Task 1](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/tree/main/Task%201)

The solutions to each exercise can be found in the following notebooks:
- **Exercise 1:** [Kaggle House Price Prediction](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task%201/KaggleHousePrice.ipynb)
- **Exercise 2:** [Titanic(DNF)](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task%201/Titanic(DNF).ipynb)
- **Exercise 3:** [BostonHousePricesPrediction(the dataset has been removed since ver 1.2)](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task%201/BostonHousePrices(sklearn).py)
