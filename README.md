# <center> PRML Notebook
**by Hyrisky He**

This repository compiles the assignments of BUPT PRML courses and my solutions to them.

I also referred Stanford's program.(CS229)\
Datasets and problems are mainly from Kaggle.([portal here](https://www.kaggle.com/))

For each assignments, solutions are provided as a `Ipython Notebook`.

## Task 1: Linear Regression

The first task deals with simple models.
- link to the solution: [Task 1](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/tree/main/Task_1)

The solutions to each exercise can be found in the following notebooks:
- **Exercise 1:** [Kaggle House Price Prediction](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task_1/KaggleHousePrice.ipynb)
- **Exercise 2:** [Titanic(DNF)](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task_1/Titanic(DNF).ipynb)
- **Exercise 3:** [BostonHousePricesPrediction(the dataset has been removed since ver 1.2)](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task_1/BostonHousePrices(sklearn).py)

## Task 2: Problem Set 1

A comprehensive assignment which contains both theoretical derivation and coding.
- link to the solution: [Task 2](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/tree/main/Task_2)

The solutions to each exercise can be found in the following notebooks:
- **PS1 paperwork:** [PS1.md](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task_2/ProblemSet1_Solution.md)
- **Program 1:** [Newton's Method](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task_2/src/p01b_logreg.py)
- **Program 2:** [GDA Practice](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task_2/src/p01e_gda.py)

## Task 3: SpamClassifier

A Spam Classifier built with SVM and Naive Bayes.
- link to the solution: [Task 3](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/tree/main/Task_3)

The solutions to each exercise can be found in the following notebooks:
- **Classifier:** [NB & SVM](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task_3/src/p06_spam.py)
- **Output:** [SpamClassifier Output](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task_3/src/output)
