# <center> Task 1
**by Hyrisky He**

For each assignments, solutions are provided as a `Ipython Notebook`.\
I have already wrote a sklearn version of these basic models, so I will only provide an uncommented version.

## Note:

Solving a problem with publicly available dataset using liner regression models.

## Tasks:

Let's try some real classic problems.
- (Kaggle House Price Prediction)[https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task%201/KaggleHousePrice.ipynb]
- (Titanic(DNF))[https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task%201/Titanic(DNF).ipynb]

## Conc:

When writing code, I realized that I am simply too weak for data processing, and I am also very unskilled in the use of packages such as pandas. So I deem it is time to learn some data manipulation skills.
