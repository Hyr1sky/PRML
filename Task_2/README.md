# <center> Task 2
**by Hyrisky He**

For this assignment, solutions are provided with `.pdf` and `.py` file.\
The `.pdf` file contains all the problems in PS1.

## Attention:

Use `print(os.getcwd())` to get the current working directory.\
For god sake, it takes me a year to solve the problem with relative path.

## Note:

Solving a problem using liner regression models.

## Tasks:

This is a multifile program, `p01b_logreg.py` implements Newton's Method to fit the linear regression, and `p01e_gda.py` implements GDA Method.
- [p01b_logreg.py](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task_2/src/p01b_logreg.py)
- [p01e_gda.py](https://github.com/Hyr1sky/PRML/blob/main/Task_2/src/p01e_gda.py)

## Conc:

Not familiar with multifile program, futhermore, I have a lot of problems with implementing the basic algorithms.
